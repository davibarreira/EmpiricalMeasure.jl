# FiniteDiscreteMeasure.jl

At the moment, this is just a copy of
CatagoricalDistributions.jl. The idea
is to extend it to deal with
multivariate finite discrete measures.

One can think of a Categorical Distribution
of $n$ labels as a Finite Discrete Measure
with point masses in $\mathbb R^n$, where
each label is in $(1,0...,0)$, $(0,1,0,...,0)$, ...,
and so on.
